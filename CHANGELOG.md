# Changelog

## 1.1.0

### Added

- **The Pokémon Center PC opens it too.** A BOXES row is inserted right under
  the box PC's own row, through the engine's `ui.pc.items` hook.

  That row is labelled "SOMEONE'S PC" until you meet Bill and "BILL'S PC"
  after, so anchoring on one label alone would have silently stopped working
  halfway through the game. Both are tried, and an unrecognised menu puts the
  row at the front rather than dropping it.

- **OPEN FROM**, choosing where it is reachable: `START+PC`, `START` or `PC`.
  Read per menu, so changing it takes effect on the next menu that opens
  rather than the next boot.

## 1.0.0

- First release. A 5x4 grid storage screen with a pick-up/put-down cursor,
  box switching on START, and a party pane on SELECT.
